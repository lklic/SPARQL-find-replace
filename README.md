# SPARQL-find-replace
a handy bash script to find and replace parts of a URI across all named graphs:
 - configured for blazegraph but can be used for other graph databases
 - specifically made for updating URI patterns, be careful if you have the '$find' text in some literal, it will also replace this.
 - use at your own risk!
